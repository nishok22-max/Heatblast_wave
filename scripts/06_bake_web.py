"""Bake the processed cube into the static assets the demo reads.

    python scripts/06_bake_web.py config/ahmedabad.yaml

This is the handoff to the frontend, and the last step that touches Python. After
this the demo is a folder of files: no server, no database, no network. Open
``web/index.html`` from file:// with the wifi off and it works (NFR-1).

SIZE BUDGET drives the shape of the output. The full cube is 392 cells x 264
hours x 5 metrics -- about half a million numbers, which is far too much JSON for
a static page. So the split is:

    hexes.geojson   full spatial detail, static per-cell properties
    hourly.json     full spatial detail, but ONLY the focus day (24 h)
    city.json       full temporal detail (all 264 h), but city aggregates only
    personas.json   persona definitions and the safe-work-window analysis
    meta.json       provenance, kill-gate numbers, and every declared caveat

That gives the map its 24-hour scrubber and the timeline its 11-day night-recovery
chart, without shipping the cross product of both.
