"""Decision-support layer: what is driving the heat, and what would help.

Everything here is computed from the same physics as the rest of the pipeline.
Nothing is illustrative and nothing is invented -- if an intervention cannot be
modelled with what we have, it is not offered rather than being faked.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT
  * headcounts ("18,420 people at risk"). We have no population data; the
    vulnerability layer is a declared placeholder. A precise-looking number
    would be the single most damaging thing this project could print.
  * water stations / hydration measures. Real and important, but hydration is
    not a thermal quantity -- our model cannot say anything about it, so it is
    not listed as though it could.

    the absolute effects, normalised.
