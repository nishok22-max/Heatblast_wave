"""Persona-level heat strain: who can do what, for how long, in this cell.

This is the layer that answers the problem statement's actual demand -- "what the
weather will *do*" -- rather than what it will be. A single WBGT value is not an
answer: 32 degC WBGT is a manageable afternoon for a seated office worker and a
medical emergency for someone laying bricks.

WHY NOT ISO 7933 PHS
--------------------
The plan called for the ISO 7933 Predicted Heat Strain model, which integrates a
body heat balance to give a core-temperature trajectory. It lives in
``pythermalcomfort``, which cannot be imported on the target machine: Windows
Application Control blocks a compiled ``scipy.optimize`` DLL that the package
pulls in transitively.

So this module uses the other standard route to the same operational answer:
**ISO 7243 WBGT reference limits** combined with **ACGIH/NIOSH work-rest
allocation**. These are lookup tables rather than a differential equation, which
means:

  + no scipy, no solver, no convergence failures on stage
  + they are what occupational hygienists and labour inspectors actually use,
    so the output maps directly onto a decision an official can sign
  - no core-temperature *curve*, only a work/rest allocation

That trade is the right way round for this prototype. Restoring PHS is a V1 item.

EVERY THRESHOLD HERE IS A PUBLISHED STANDARD except the vulnerability offsets,
which are explicitly flagged as a judgement.
