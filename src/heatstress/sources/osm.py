"""OpenStreetMap urban form via the Overpass API.

Supplies the intra-city signal that coarse reanalysis cannot: which
neighbourhoods are dense impervious mass and which are green or watered.

WHY THIS AND NOT SATELLITE LST, FOR THE PROTOTYPE
-------------------------------------------------
  * no registration, no API key, no approval wait
  * pure JSON over HTTP -- no GeoTIFF, no rasterio/GDAL, so it is immune to the
    Application Control policy that blocks compiled extensions on this machine
  * works for any city on earth immediately, which is what makes adding a second
    (humid) pilot city a two-line change rather than a new scene hunt
  * it is the same signal WUDAPT Local Climate Zones encode, just computed from
    vectors instead of read from a categorical raster

Production swaps in Landsat land-surface temperature behind the same
``UrbanFormSource`` interface. Nothing downstream changes.

RESPONSES ARE CACHED TO ``data/raw``. Overpass is rate-limited and occasionally
slow; the demo must never depend on it (NFR-1).
